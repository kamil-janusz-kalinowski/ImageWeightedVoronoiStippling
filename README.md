# Voronoi Diagram Animation Generator
This repository contains Python scripts for generating dynamic Voronoi diagrams. Voronoi diagrams are a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. The scripts in this repository use this concept to create interesting animations.

Sure, here's the addendum for the repository:

## Update!!!
Due to optimization issues, the code has been rewritten in JavaScript and is now available in a public repository at the following link: https://github.com/kamil-janusz-kalinowski/ImageWeightedVoronoiStipplingJS.
